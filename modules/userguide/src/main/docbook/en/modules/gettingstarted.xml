    <title>Downloading and installing jBPM</title>    
    <para>To get the latest release jBPM 3 version, go to 
    the <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=70542&amp;package_id=145174">jBPM jPDL 3 
    package on Sourceforge.net</ulink> and download the latest installer.
    </para>
    <para id="jbpm-installer-{version}.jar"><emphasis role="bold">The jBPM installer</emphasis> 
    creates a runtime installation and it can also download and install the 
    eclipse designer and a jboss server.  You can use jBPM also without application server, but all of 
    these components are preconfigured to interoperate out-of-the-box to get you started with jBPM quickly.
    To launch the installer, open a command line and go to the directory where you downloaded it.
    Then type: 
    </para>
    <programlisting>java -jar jbpm-installer-{version}.jar</programlisting>
    <para>
    Step through the instructions.  Any supported version of JBoss and the exact version 
    of eclipse can optionally be downloaded by the installer.
    </para>
    <para>When installing jBPM into JBoss, this will create a jBPM directory into a server 
    configuration's deploy directory.  All jBPM files are centralized inside this <literal>deploy/jbpm</literal>
    directory.  No other files of your JBoss installation will be touched.  
    </para>
    <para>You can use your own eclipse (if it is version 3.4+) or 
    you can use the eclipse that the installer downloaded.  To install the graphical process designer in 
    eclipse, just use the eclipse update mechanism (Help --> Software Updates --> ...) and point it to the 
    file <literal>designer/jbpm-jpdl-designer-site.zip</literal>.</para>
